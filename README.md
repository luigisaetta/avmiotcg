This repository contains most of the work I have done to develop a working prototype for a
Cloud Gateway for an Automatic Vehicle Monitoring System (AVM)
based on Oracle IoT Cloud Service

The Gateway now support two protocols for incoming messages:
* HTTP
* MQTT

a custom input msg format is embedded in the code, but it can easily be changed

29/05: added support for Docker
